This package used to convert ship linesplan data to .pat file.

The nested structure is as follows:

Ship_mesh.py yes|
        | load_linesplan and sort the panel points yes|
                           | scale_linesplan with scaling factors |
                           | cut the ship by draft and depth, if the draft is above the depth, just extend without cutting |
                                             | calculate the natural frequency (omega) of the vessel motion, and define the panel size with wave_length (omega)
                                             | KG yes  |
                                             | Kxx yes |
                                             | Kyy yes |
                                             | water_depth yes |
                                                            | evenly interpolate the collocation points along the crossections and the keel |
                                                                                                                                    | mesh the point cloud |
                                                                                                                                    | save the coordinate, index and connectivity in vtk file|
